# README

The SkyBot is a free and open source discord bot. The main repository ("repo") is owned by Skyler Kerr and can be found at [github.com/SkyKerr/SkyBot](http://github.com/SkyKerr/SkyBot). Contributions are welcome and can be made there.

Use of the bot using the code from the repo requires the creation of a configuration file 'config.json' containing the private key of a discord bot, which can be created at the Discord Developer Portal ([https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)). Run using `python .`

A Changelog for all versions can be found at ~/changelog.md .
